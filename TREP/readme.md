## Todo:
- [ ]  Clean up the mess!!!
- [ ]  Functions gg2Addr() and addr2Gg(). Also improve it
- [ ]  Function highlightAnimation()
- [ ]  Align the tile editor with CSS (flexbox problem I guess)
- [ ]  Allow bitwise shift for the tiles
- [ ]  Implement OAM palettes :-| <-- this is going to be tricky AF!
- [ ]  Hover on tiles highlights VRAM tile set
- [ ]  Have the slider and the tile zoom always be the same
- [ ]  Make the rotation matrix for the pieces (4x4, if possible)

## Future Tasks 
- [ ]  make the header data editable
- [ ]  Add a ROM map (https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy):ROM_map)
- [ ]  Add a RAM map (https://datacrystal.romhacking.net/wiki/Tetris_(Game_Boy):RAM_map)
- [ ]  Check out how difficult it is to work with ROMs that require ROM bank switching
- [ ]  Maybe the banks are at fixed positions - then it shouldn't be a problem

## Tasks for the distant future (maybe?)
- [ ]  Find the OP-codes and also show these in assembly style
- [ ]  Identify tables and tile maps
