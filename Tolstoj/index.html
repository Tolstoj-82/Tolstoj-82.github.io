                <h3>1991 - Game Boy</h3>
                <p>My Tetris journey could have started in 1991, when us kids were gifted a Game Boy for Christmas. The two games that we received alongside the console were Tetris and Super Mario Land. I found Tetris to be boring and avoided it. My older brother and my father, however fell in love with the game and played it often.</p>
                
                <h3>The early 2000s</h3>
                <p>Years passed and I discovered Tetris every now and again and played it aimlessly for a while.</p>
                
                <h3>2005 - Game Boy Re-discovered</h3>
                
                <h3>2007 - Tetris Friends</h3>
                
                <h2>Why Tolstoj is the perfect name (in my opinion)</h2>
